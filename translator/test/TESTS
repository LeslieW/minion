TEST DIRECTORY
==============

1) Tests
----------
A test-instance consists of a basic Essence' model with the extension .cm 
and a parameter-file specifying the model-instance with extension .param.


2) Filename conventions
------------------------
You can name your test-instance either by name or by purpose (or whatever!), 
followed by a running number. By convention, if parameter and extension 
filenames have the same name and running number, e.g. test11b.cm, test11a.param 
then it is assumed, that they can be used together for a testrun.


3) Test types
-------------- 
There are 3 different test types; each separated in a subdirectory. Please
place your test-instance into the corresponding directory.

1) /passing tests: 
   contains tests that pass (iff they should pass).

2) /failing tests: 
   containts tests that do not pass (iff they should not pass) and
   fail in an acceptable way (exceptions). Tests resulting in 
   segmentation faults (or similar) are not allowed in this directory!

3) /should_test:
   contains tests that SHOULD work (some day) or SHOULD fail in an acceptable way,
   but simply don't (due to certain/unknown reasons). One fine day, all test in the 
   should-directory will hopefully end up in either passing_tests and failing_tests
   directory :)
