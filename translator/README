=================================================================================================
 Essence' Translator (Tailor) v1.0
=================================================================================================
support: andrea@cs.st-andrews.ac.uk (Andrea Rendl)


This translator (called Tailor) converts models expressed in Essence'[1] to the Minion
input format. The parser of the Essence' language has been constructed
using the LALR parser generator Java Cup[2] in combination with the 
Scanner generator jflex[3], both released under GPL[4]. 

For further details see the documentation in doc/index.html.


1. Running the Essence' Translator
----------------------------------

The translator is packed in an executable .jar file, tailor.jar, so you will need
Java Sun's JDK[5]. To execute tailor.jar change to the translator's
root directory and type

java -jar tailor.jar

which will start the graphical version of the translator. For the
command line version type 

java -jar tailor.jar -help

for further details.



2. Compiling the Essence' Translator
------------------------------------
Compiling the translator is not necessary in order to run the
translator since it comes with a .jar file but you are still welcome
to modify the code.
The Translator is written in Java, so you will need a current version
of Java (1.5) for compilation.
Run the script compile.sh on the root directory. Use build.sh if you
additionally want to rebuild the Essence'-parser (for which you will
need jflex[2] and Java-Cup[3] installed).



3. Documentation
----------------
Documentation can be found at tailor-doc/index.html in a release archive, 
or doc/index.html in SVN, that contains links to several Essence' examples, 
the Essence' grammar specification, and the translator API.



4. Essence' examples
--------------------
4.1 Problem Samples
Several problem samples can be found in the /tailor-examples directory in a 
release archive, or the /problems directory in SVN. All problem samples are 
documented.

4.2 Test Instances
A large amount of test instances can be found in the /test directory in SVN. 
It also contains a directory of generated Minion files. 



5. Limitations and Known Bugs
-----------------------------
The translator is still under development, so there are some limitations. 
The following is not supported yet:
- decision variable arrays with 4 or more dimensions
- parameter arrays with 4 or more dimensions
- absolute value
- power with decision variable as exponent
- element constraint on 2-dimensional arrays
