 Essence' Translator  v0.1
=================================================================================================
support: andrea@cs.st-andrews.ac.uk (Andrea Rendl)


This translator converts models expressed in Essence'[1] to the Minion
input format.


1. Compiling the Essence' Translator
------------------------------------
The Translator is written in Java, so you will need a current version
of Java (1.5) for compilation.
Run the script compile.sh on the root directory. Use build.sh if you
additionally want to rebuild the Essence'-parser (for which you will
need jflex[2] and Java-Cup[3] installed).


2. Running the Essence' Translator
----------------------------------
Change to the /bin directory and call EssencePrimeTranslator with Java:

java EssencePrimeTranslator <Essence'-specification-file>   <Essence'-parameter-file>   [<output-file>]
 
The last parameter is optional. If the output-filename is omitted, 
the Essence' Translator will generate the file "outFile". There are 
also a set of flags for the translation. For further information call
"java EssencePrimeTranslator" without arguments.


3. Documentation
----------------
Documentation can be found at /doc/index.html, that contains links to several 
Essence' examples, the Essence' grammar specification, the Minion manual 
and the translator API.


4. Essence' examples
--------------------
4.1 Problem Samples
Several problem samples can be found in the /problems directory. 

4.2 Test Instances
A large amount of test instances can be found in the /test directory. It also
contains a directory of generated Minion files. 


5. Limitations and Known Bugs
-----------------------------
The translator is still under development, so there are some limitations. 
The following is not supported yet:
- decision variable arrays with 4 or more dimensions
- parameter arrays with 4 or more dimensions
- absolute value
- power with decision variable as exponent
- element constraint on 2-dimensional arrays
- sparse domains
