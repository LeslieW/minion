<h3 id="bibd">1. Balanced Incomplete Block Design (BIBD)</h3>

 <p>The problem is to assign v objects to b blocks such that such that each block
 contains k different objects, each object occurrs in exactly 
 r different blocks and every 2 distinct objects occurr in 
 exactly l blocks.
 
 We represent the problem by a vxb matrix of booleans, where 
 matrix[i,j] equals 1(true) iff object i has been assign to 
 block j. 
 Below is the solution for the sample instance 
 with v,b,k,r,l = 7,7,3,3,1.
</p>
<pre>
    0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1
    0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1
    0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0
    0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0
    1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0
    1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0 
    1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1  
</pre>
</p>

<p>The <a href="../examples/bibd/bibd.eprime">problem model</a> 
is given in the <a href="../examples/">examples directory</a> 
together with some parameter instances.

<h3 id="farm">2. Farm Puzzle</h3>

<p>
 This is a very simple puzzle:
 A farmer has 7 animals on his farm: pigs and hens.
 They all together have 22 legs. How many pigs and how many
 hens does the farmer have?

<h3 id="grocery">3. Grocery Puzzle</h3>
 <p>A girl goes to a shop and buys 4 items. When the cashier charges
  7.11 Euro he notices that he accidently multiplied the prices 
  of the items. So he adds up the prices and suprisingly he gets
  the same amount, 7.11 Euro. How much did each item cost?

<h3 id="langford">4. Langford's Number Problem</h3>

<p>We have a model of the Langford-2 problem:
 arrange 2 sets of positive integers 1..k to a sequence,
 such that, following the first occurence of an integer i, 
 each subsequent occurrence of i, appears i+1 indices later
 than the last. 
 For example, for k=4, a solution would be 41312432.
</p>

<p>We model this problem using a 1-dimensional array <i>'position'</i> with length 2*k
where the first k entries of the array hold the position of the i-th
number, i.e. <i>position[2]</i> holds the position of the first
occurrence of '2' in the sequence. In the sample solution for k=4,
<i>position[2]</i> would hold the value '5', because '2' occurs 
first as 5th number in the sequence.<br>
The second k entries in the array hold the second occurrence of each
value in the sequence. Below we try to illustrate the relation 
between <i>position</i> and the sequence for the example with k=4.
</p>

<pre>
sequence :   4 1 3 1 2 4 3 2

position    [2,5,3,1,4,8,7,6]   
of numbers   1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4

<h3 id="nqueens">5. N-Queens Problem</h3>
<p>Place n queens on a nxn chessboard
 without attacking each other. A sample 
solution for n=8 is given in the picture.
</p>
<table>

<img src="nqueens.png">

<td> We have two models of the n-queens problem: a 
<a href="../examples/n_queens2.eprime">standard model</a>
and a more <a href=="../examples/n_queens1.eprime">
sophisticated model</a>, both available in the 
in the <a href="../examples/">examples directory</a> .

<h3 id="pac">6. Peaceable Army of Queens Problem</h3>

<table>
 <tr>
   <td>
<p>
 Place 2 equally-sized armies of queens (white and black)
 on a chess board without attacking each other and 
 maximise the size of the armies. The picture to the right
shows an example of two armies of queens (including a king
on each side), where no queens of different colours can 
attack another.
</p>
<p>
We model the problem by representing the board with a 
nxn matrix (2-dimensional array) that can take 3 values:
0,1 or 2. If a field is set to 0, it is not occupied,
if a field is set to 1/2 it is occupied by a white/black 
queen.

<h3 id="translator">How does the Translator work?</h3>

The translator works in several steps:

<ol>

<li>Parse input
</li>

<li>Map the syntax tree to an advanced representation
</li>

<li>Insert parameter values and constant values
</li>

<li>Normalise model (ordering, evaluation and restructuring of expressions)
</li>

<li>Flatten model
</li>

<li>Tailor flat model to solver constraints
</li>

</ol>

If you want to learn more about the structure of the Translator, then 
please consult the <a href="api/index.html">API</a> of the translator.



<h3 id="question">I have a question that has not been answered here. What can I do?</h3>

If you have any questions or comments concerning the Translator
 then please feel free to contact <a href="http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~andrea/">Andrea Rendl</a>.
