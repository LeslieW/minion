<h3 id="bibd">1. Balanced Incomplete Block Design (BIBD)</h3>

 <p>The problem is to assign v objects to b blocks such that such that each block
 contains k different objects, each object occurrs in exactly 
 r different blocks and every 2 distinct objects occurr in 
 exactly l blocks.
 
 We represent the problem by a vxb matrix of booleans, where 
 matrix[i,j] equals 1(true) iff object i has been assign to 
 block j. 
 Below is the solution for the sample instance 
 with v,b,k,r,l = 7,7,3,3,1.
</p>
<pre>
    0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1
    0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1
    0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0
    0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0
    1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0
    1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0

<p>
 This is a very simple puzzle:
 A farmer has 7 animals on his farm: pigs and hens.
 They all together have 22 legs. How many pigs and how many
 hens does the farmer have?

<h3 id="grocery">3. Grocery Puzzle</h3>
 <p>A girl goes to a shop and buys 4 items. When the cashier charges
  7.11 Euro he notices that he accidently multiplied the prices 
  of the items. So he adds up the prices and suprisingly he gets
  the same amount, 7.11 Euro. How much did each item cost?

<h3 id="langford">4. Langford's Number Problem</h3>

<p>We have a model of the Langford-2 problem:
 arrange 2 sets of positive integers 1..k to a sequence,
 such that, following the first occurence of an integer i, 
 each subsequent occurrence of i, appears i+1 indices later
 than the last. 
 For example, for k=4, a solution would be 41312432.
</p>

<p>We model this problem using a 1-dimensional array <i>'position'</i> with length 2*k
where the first k entries of the array hold the position of the i-th
number, i.e. <i>position[2]</i> holds the position of the first
occurrence of '2' in the sequence. In the sample solution for k=4,
<i>position[2]</i> would hold the value '5', because '2' occurs 
first as 5th number in the sequence.<br>
The second k entries in the array hold the second occurrence of each
value in the sequence. Below we try to illustrate the relation 
between <i>position</i> and the sequence for the example with k=4.
</p>

<pre>
sequence :   4 1 3 1 2 4 3 2

position    [2,5,3,1,4,8,7,6]   
of numbers   1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4

<p>
 Place 2 equally-sized armies of queens (white and black)
 on a chess board without attacking each other and 
 maximise the size of the armies. The picture to the right
shows an example of two armies of queens (including a king
on each side), where no queens of different colours can 
attack another.
</p>
<p>
We model the problem by representing the board with an 
nxn matrix (2-dimensional array) that can take 3 values:
0,1 or 2. If a field is set to 0, it is not occupied,
if a field is set to 1/2 it is occupied by a white/black 
queen.

<h3 id="quasigroup">7. Quasigroup Existence Problems</h3>

A quasigroup is an mxm miltiplication table of integers 1..m, 
where each element occurrs exactly once in each row and column and certain 
multiplication axioms hold. Depending on the multiplication axiom,
the quaisgroup is enumerated (i.e. <i>quasigroup3</i>  denotes that
mutliplication axiom 3 holds).
We have models for several versions of the quasigroup existence problems:

 Sokoban (Japanese for <i>warehouse keeper</i>) is a transport puzzle. The
 game was invented by Hiroyuki Imabayashi, and was published by
 Thinking Rabbit, a computer games company in the town of Takarazuka,
 Japan. The game is composed of a two dimensional layout of a
 warehouse laid out on a rectangular grid. An empty cell indicates a 
 part of the warehouse floor where the porter can move freely. The 
 walls constitute the boundaries of the warehouse. Some of the floor 
 cells contain crates. Each crate is a 1x1 square occupying a single 
 cell. These crates are to be moved into designated target positions
 by a porter. The number of target positions and the number of crates
 should be the same. The crates cannot be pulled and can be pushed 
 only one at a time. Thus at a time, a cell may be empty, occupied by 
 the porter, a packet, a target position or a part of the warehouse
 wall.<br>
 <br>
 The image to the right shows a version of the Sokoban game (with 
 diamonds instead of crates) and was taken from 
<a href="http://w3.ift.ulaval.ca/~dogen19/ift-17587/TP1/">a Sokoban page<a/>.

<h3 id="sonet">9. SONET Problem</h3>

<p>
The SONET problem is a network design problem: set up a network between
n nodes, where only certain nodes require a connection.
Nodes are connected by putting them on a ring, where all nodes
on a ring can communicate. Putting a node on a ring requires a
so-called ADM, and each ring has a capacity of nodes, i.e. ADMs. There is a certain 
amount of rings, r, that is available. The objective is to set up a network
by using a minimal amount of ADMs.
</p>
<p>
The problem model has the amount of rings ('r'), amount of nodes('n'),
 the 'demand' (which nodes require communication) and node-capacity 
 of each ring ('capacity_nodes') as parameters.
 The assignement of nodes to rings is modelled by a 2-dimensional 
 matrix 'rings',
 indexed by the amnount of rings and nodes. The matrix-domain is boolean:
 If the node in column j is assigned to the ring in row i, then rings[i,j] = 1 
 and 0 otherwise. So all the '1's in the matrix 'rings' stand for an ADM.
 Hence the objective is to minimise the sum over all columns and rows 
of matrix 'rings'.
