<h3 id="introduction">1. What is all this?</h3>
This is the manual for the Essence' to MINION translator. 

<a href ="grammar.pdf">Essence'</a>
is a solver-independent constraint modelling language
and <a href="http://minion.sourceforge.net/">MINION</a> is a fast
 constraint solver. MINION's input language is very simple
and restricted 
and therefore problem modelling is a challenging task.
This translator creates (mostly very effective)
MINION input instance from an Essence' problem model.
Essence' examples can be found <a href="../problems">here</a>.
Please note that the translator and this manual are still 
under developement.

<hr>

<h3 id="essence">2. What is Essence'?</h3>
Essence' is a solver-independent Constraint modelling language.
It allows to express a lot of Constraint problems rather easily
and on a rather abstract level. It is solver-independent because 
it is no input language for a specific Constraint solver, but
is on a level that most Constraint Solvers support.
Furthermore, Essence' is a subset of the more
abstract problem specification language <a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/aig/constraints/AutoModel/">Essence</a>.  
<a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/aig/constraints/AutoModel/">Here</a> 
you can find out more about Essence and Essence' and its related 
research. If you want to see <a href="../examples">some examples of Essence'</a>, click
<a href="../examples">here</a>.  


<hr>

<h3 id="minion">3. What is Minion?</h3>
<a href="http://minion.sourceforge.net/">Minion</a> is a very fast 
Constraint solver which is available for free under the GNU GPL licence
over sourceforge at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/minion/">
http://sourceforge.net/projects/minion/</a>.
Its input language is very simple and therefore modelling efficiently is rather difficult
(and not very pleasant). 
<a href="http://minion.sourceforge.net/">Here</a> you can find out
more about Minion.  


<hr>

<h3 id="whyTranslator">4. Why should I use this Translator?</h3>
The Translator allows you to formulate your Constraint problem in
Essence' and can then 
<ol>
<li> translate the problem instance into an effective Minion input
file (by applying several model-enhancing reformulations) and 
gives you an overview of the translation steps
</li>

<li> run the generated Minion instance 
in Minion (provided  you have a version of Minion installed)
</li>

<li>return the results of your problem instance 
(if there are any) together with some statistical data 
in Essence' format. 
</li>
</ol>

Hence you have a pleasant environment for modelling, are sure to get
an efficient Minion instance without having
to interfere with Minion at all.

More experienced Constraint modellers can also adapt features 
for the solving process such as branching strategies or variable
orderings. 


<hr>

<h3 id="compiling">5. How can I compile the Translator?</h3>
Compiling the translator is not necessary in order to run the
translator since it comes with a .jar file but you are still welcome
to modify the code.
The Translator is written in <a href="http://www.java.com/">Java</a>, so you will need a current version
(>= 1.5.0) of Java for compilation.
Run the script <code>compile.sh</code> on the root directory. 
If you want to rebuild the Essence' parser, run  <code>build.sh</code> instead of <code>compile.sh</code>
(please note, that you will need the Lexer Generator <a href=" http://www.jflex.de/">jflex</a> and 
the parser generator <a href="http://www2.cs.tum.edu/projects/cup/">java-cup</a> 
installed in order to do that).


<hr>

<h3 id="running">6. How can I run the Translator?</h3>
The translator is packed in an executable .jar file, <code>translator.jar</code>, so you will need
Java's <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAR_(file_format)">jar</a> that
comes with Sun's JDK which is available <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">here</a>. 
To execute <code>translator.jar</code>
change to the root directory of the translator and execute the Essence' Translator with:<br>
<br>
<center>
<code>java -jar translator.jar</code><br>
 </center>
<br>
which will start the graphical user interface of the translator. If you want to use 
the command-line version, then type<br>
<br>
<center>
	<code>java -jar translator.jar problemFile.eprime</code>
</center>
<br>
to translate a problem file (without parameter values) to Minion input. The resulting
Minion input file will be stored in the same directory as the problem file and is named 
after the problem file with an additional .minion extension. <br>
If you have an additional parameter file for the 
problem class, type<br>
<br>
<center>
	<code>java -jar translator.jar problemFile.eprime parameterFile.param</code>
</center>
<br>
which will generate a Minion input file (stored in the same directory as the parameter file)  
that is named after the parameter file with an additional .minion extension. For more
information type<br>
<br>
<center>
	<code>java -jar translator.jar -help</code>
</center>

<h3 id="bug">7. I found a bug...again! Where should I report it?</h3>
Thanks for finding that bug! Please report it to 
<a href="mailto:andrea@cs.st-and.ac.uk">Andrea</a>.


<hr>


<h3 id="examples">8. Where can I find Essence' Examples?</h3>
There are several Essence' examples in the <code>examples/</code>
directory and overview with example descriptions can be found 
<a href="examples.html">here</a>. 

<hr>

<h3 id="grammar">9. Where can I find the grammar of Essence'?</h3>
You can find the grammar of Essence' <a href="grammar.pdf">here</a>.

<hr>

<h3 id="modelling">10. How do I model problems with Essence'?</h3>
You can find a little introduction into modelling with 
Essence' <a href="modelling.html">here</a>.


<hr>

<h3 id="translator">12. How does the Translator work?</h3>

The translator works in several steps:

<ol>

<li>Parse input
</li>

<li>Map the syntax tree to an advanced representation
</li>

<li>Insert parameter values and constant values
</li>

<li>Normalise model (ordering, evaluation and restructuring of expressions)
</li>

<li>Flatten model
</li>

<li>Tailor flat model to solver constraints
</li>

</ol>


If you want to learn more about the structure of the Translator, then 
please consult the <a href="api/index.html">API</a> of the translator.

<hr>

<h3 id="question">13. I have a question that has not been answered here. What can I do?</h3>

If you have any questions or comments concerning the Translator
 then please feel free to contact <a href="mailto:andrea@cs.st-and.ac.uk">Andrea Rendl</a>.
