==============================
EMACS MODE FOR ESSENCE'
==============================

The Emacs mode for Essence' has been provided by
Peter Gregory. It does syntax highlighting of Essence'
files in Emacs [1].

To use it, you need to put the following lines in your 
~/.emacs file, while obviously changing the path 
to wherever you put eprime-mode.el:

(setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.eprime" . eprime-mode) auto-mode-alist))
(autoload 'eprime-mode "/path/to/where/you/put/eprime-mode" "Major mode for Essence'" t)

If you have altered the Emacs mode to provide some advanced features,
then please let me (andrea@cs.st-and.ac.uk) know.
