2006-05-04
- added negation and tested it

2006-04-26
- implemented new method to deal with equality assignment (variable reuse)
  works only if the assignment is explicit for each variable. Does not
  work with whole vectors or matrices yet, but binary expressions in the 
  indices are no problem now. If some variables are not assigned, the 
  "filling up" of unset spaces still needs to be implemented (tomorrow..)
- variable reuse also works for 3-dim matrices now
 
2006-04-25
- added 3-dimensional matrices of decision variables
  and basic operation on them work (any binary relations,
  quantifications, except variable reuse and global constraints) 
- fixed some bugs

2006-04-04
- fixed bug with iterated arithm. expressions
- updated and extended problem samples with
  problem descriptions etc

2006-04-02
- fixed and tested constant arrays
- added new version of sudoku
- still got to fix bug for iterated sum != iterated sum:
  could be adapted to handle to iterated arithmetic subtrees
  (see n-queens)

2006-04-02
- added iterated disjunction/conjunction
- added constant arrays, but still buggy if they occurr in 
quantifications

2006-03-30
- fixed iterated arithmetic constraints (mapping to (weighted) sum)
- still to do: map partwise structures
- map disjunctions/conjunctions (should be rather easy now with the new structure
  added today)
- fixed bug concerning translation of special boolean cases
- still todo: don't apply watch/weighted etc if we need to reify->
  clashes with global willBeReified (so stupid!)

2006-03-29
- added objective
- extended and fixed matrix indexing with variables
- little bug fixes
- updated tutorial

2006-03-22
- added discrete bounds variables 
- added discrete bound variable flag
- added langford problem
- bug fixes and little changes

2006-03-21
- a lot of bug fixes
- added some smarter translation parts 
  (in dynamic matrix assignments)
- added quasiGroup problem
- still struggling with the golomb ruler *grrr*

2006-03-20
- added watched literal constraints
- bug fixes

2006-03-17
- eq basically works, only problem with offsets of matrices, seems as 
  if we might have to add an own matrix-type to minionModel

2006-03-16
- added equality thing and did not test it -> probably totally buggy
- still missing: indices that are binary expressions
- checkIfEqualityThing-method need checking if dynamic matrix-accessing is done
  (in which case we cannot aply the eq-thing)

2006-03-15
- lex constraint/operators added
- reification flag added to every translation method (when necessary):
  allows smarter translation when we the generated constraint won't be reified
- diseq and ineq have alternatives when being reified now (minion does not support reified (dis|in)eq)
- unused binding variableas are removed and quantifiers reduced if possible
- to be done: matrix assignments for special quantified eq-constraints, baeeeh

2006-03-05
- quantification translation works now
- added element constraint for "dynamic" matrix/vector accessing
- some little thing still to do (undefined parameters in binding variable domains,
  deal with unsued binding variables))
- added tutorial in html
- translated bombasticProblem

2006-03-02
- quantification translation seems to work now
- still need to implement to apply the element constraint in cases
  like YYY [6, XXX[6]].
- bibd and sudoku are both translatable and solvable by Minion :) 

2006-28-02
- the quantification translation seems to work now pretty well
- there is still a bug with the sum quantification -> there
  are too many variables introduced than should be (and which are never used).
- I also encountered another problem: Minion cannot deal with decision
  variables that are never used in constraints, so I have to find a way to 
  determine which decision variables are actually used :(
  (that's why the BIBD instance would not work)

2006-02-19
- added 2-dim arrays, still VERY buggy!!
- added element constraint, not tested yet

2006-02-16
- added allDifferent constraint and facilities to translate other 
  global Constraints
- extended the parser so that "element" and "occurrence" are also part
  of the global constraints
- several bug-fixes 

2006-02-07
- all single quantifiers work now - including the existential
  quantifier!!!
- tested them -> see testcases in /test folder

2006-02-06
had to reimplement and rethink the quantification translation part:
- added smart translation background, that allows nesting 
  of up to 3 quantifiers (vector, matrix, cube representation
  of generated expressions) and would be easily extendable for more nesting.
- expression generation (for up to 3 nested quantifiers) implemented and tested :)
- translation of single universal quantifier and sum works

2006-02-03
- total thing is restructered and looks much better :)
- quantification is working for universal quantifier
- forall-nestings still don't not work yet...
- almost fully documented, still needs a revision

2006-02-01
- stuff is almost completely restructered. Just the quantifications are 
  missing in the expressionTranslation part
- needs further documentation
- put the whole new thing into the src-folder of SVN - still have to test if everything
 works!

2006-01-30/31
- further restructoring and refactoring

2006-01-29
- further restructuring
- refactoring EssencePrime specification

2006-01-23
- restructered the whole thing to make it more extendable and understandable.
- divide into significant parts: solver independent <-> solver dependent

2006-01-03
- fixed some bugs (all that were mentioned before, except the problem with
  unused variables in quantifications).
- matrx-indices work now completely
- TODO: 
  - nested quantification
  - existential quantifier
  - sum-quantification
- new PROBLEM: Minion cannot translate refied min,max,diseq constraints. 
  Should we ignore that or alter the translation (if even possible?)

2006-01-02
- weird problem solved: fixed the bug
- still has a bug: if variable in quantification declared but not 
  used, it prints the expressions multiple times.
- bug: golomb ruler still does not work: strange index out of bounds
  exception raised
- total removal of atomic "true"s does not completelty work yet:
  check multiple "true"s.

2006-12-27
- restriction on domains is working now in quantification
- new bugs: unused quantification-variables

2006-12-18
- fixed some bugs
- extended quantification: now it works with more than 2 binding variables
  with the universal quantifier.
- found another bug: there is still a problem with negations 

2006-12-15
- fixed loads of bugs
- created loads of new bugs :)
- added parts of forall-quantification (see test-folder)
  (works now for quantification on 1 or 2 binding-vars, so something 
  does not work with nesting. also have a look at equality:
  does not work on equ like x[i] = y[j] -> why not?? (toplevel?)
- added copy() function for expressions (so for almost everything)

2006-12-12
- extended feasible top-level operators to all relops
- found loads of bugs conceerning matrix-domains:
  look at should-folder containing golomb-ruler.
  Problem: identifiers defining domains of matrices:
	something does not work here

2006-12-11
- fixed bugs
- matrices (1-dimensional) are now translatable! :)
  in arbitrary expressions (except quantifier which I haven't
  done yet)

2006-12-08
- fixed a lot of bugs
- expanded boolean expression translation 
  (now in all cases - including special simple case)

2006-11-28
- added proper reification

2006-11-24
- added structure for constraints in Minion in order to
  add reification and adapted MinionModel.java
- created package minionModel to get a nicer structure
- fixed some little bugs

2006-11-17
- fixed a lot of bugs
- all expressions evaluated except power
- translated expressions: binary (except power - as soon as chris implements power constraint)
- evaluates and translates all domains except matrix-domains (only eval)
- extended to introduce multi-dimensional matrices
- evaluation of quantified constraints
- i expect the code to be really buggy now, but i just have to call it a weekend ;) 

2006-11-15
- fixed small bugs
- added file-output with user-defined filename
- added "generated_files" directory in tests
- added MinionGlobals (for MinionVersion, setting var/val ordering etc) 

2006-11-14
- added and tested (multiple nested) substraction
  (implemented weighted*eqSum)
- generated first real CP model: send more money
 (unfortunately does not give a solution in Minion,
  even though it seemed right - have to check)
- new test instances

2006-11-13
- fixed some little bugs
- temporary variables are created smarter now:
  (less eq-constraints and less tmp vars)
  implemented (and tested) only for addition, mulitplication
- new test instances


2006-11-10
- introduced temporary variables with binary 
  addition and multiplication constraints
  -> question comes up on how to best create 
     the domain of tmpvars (sparse, etc)
- fixed some little bugs
- successfully tested tmp vars and domains of tmp vars

2006-10-30
- did some restructuring: ExpressionEvaluator-class
- added big part of advanced expression-evaluation
  (still some things missing)
- added some test-cases (are still in shouldtests-directory
  because it needs temporary vars to translated without error)

2006-10-25
- added expression evaluation
- tested expression evaluation
- added corresponding test instances
- updated grammar and notes

2006-10-22
- added (atomic) domain parameters
- new test instances
- grammar update

2006-10-19
- Added structered test-directory
- Added more features for parameters
  (now they totally (seem to) work for bools, numbers)
- altered grammar

2006-10-18 
- Added (very simple) parameters
- fixed bugs concerning the "restriction mode globals"
- altered grammar

2006-10-17 
- Introduced global constants for "restriction modes" for the Essence Parser
in the interface EssenceGlobals.java
