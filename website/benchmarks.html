Benchmarks are provided in the source distribution of Minion, together with 
programs to generate new benchmarks from various problem classes.
As well as this, we aim to archive the specific benchmarks used in papers on Minion.   As well as providing sample sets of benchmarks, this will enhance the reproducibility of our research.    Researchers may run Minion on exactly the instances reported in our papers.
