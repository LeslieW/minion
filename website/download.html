From time to time we release executables of Minion and source files.   
These reflect stable points in development or versions of particular interest.  
<ul>
<p>August 27, 2006: While no stable releases have been made, progress on Minion has been
continuing! This release fixes a number of bugs and add a few new command line switches
(run minion without command line options to see them). One major point to note in this version
is for sanity checking, Minion now checks any solutions generated to make sure they satisfy all
the constraints. This should stop any false positive results but does create a slight slowdown
on problems with very many solutions. For benchmarking a version should be compiled without the
-DMORE_SEARCH_INFO command line flag. This version of Minion has also been compiled to support the
largest possible array of processors, and compiling specifically for a certain level of processor can
often improve speed substansally. E-mail if you want a version for benchmarking on a specific machine!
This release is based on subversion release 240.

This corresponds to revision 170 in <a href="http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.cgi/minion/">Minion's subversion repository.</a>

All files from currently available releases of Minion are available from sourceforge.</a></p>

At all times the source code of the latest version of Minion is available through the use of a Subversion server. Subversion is a version control system for source code. Details of how to use subversion are given at <a href=http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=159145>the Minion project page at sourceforge.net.</a>
It is important to note that this source code is subject to more changes than our periodic releases and hence is less stable.  
The subversion server can also be viewed through a web browser at: <a href=http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.cgi/minion/>http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.cgi/minion/ </a>
