MINION was started as an academic research project, and we envision that it will continue to be used in a research context, as well as being of use to the wider CP community.

The following paper describes the design principles behind Minion.  It was 
chosen as one of the ten best papers out of about 500 submissions for ECAI 06.

Minion features "watched literals", an implementation idea for propagation algorithms which has proved very successful in SAT.   The following paper 
describes watched literals and other kinds of watched triggers for constraint propagation.
