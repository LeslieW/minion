Minion Release 0.1

Minion is still currently a little on the unstable size, and prone to 
major changes on a regular basis. Use with caution!


MinionBIBDInstanceGenerator will generate instances of the BIBD.

MinionInputReader.cpp will read these files and print a count of solutions found and nodes taken.

Note by default MinionInputReader.h compiles in DEBUG mode, and prints lots of messages about correct parsing of files. To disable this, and get a *much* faster run-time, compile with -DNO_DEBUG. The best way of compiling is:

g++ MinionInputReader.cpp -O2 -DNO_DEBUG -finline void-functions -funit-at-a-time

Your version of g++ might not support -funit-at-a-time. You can compile at -O3, but it will take *much* longer for not a huge amount of gain.

Note Minion requires g++ 4.0 or above. If you try compiling and get a bunch of error messages, post them to the mailing list and I'll have a look. This code hasn't been compiled on many computers yet, so I wouldn't be shocked if people have trouble compiling it.

Note the current reader is very wobbly. Very soon it will be replaced by an XML one, which will be much more stable :)
